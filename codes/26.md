### Edit Distance Problem

The **Edit Distance Problem** is a classic dynamic programming problem used to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another. Operations typically include insertion, deletion, or substitution of characters. This problem is widely used for comparing strings and selecting the best technology options based on similarity.

#### Problem Statement

Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, compute the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to convert `str1` into `str2`.

#### C++ Code

Here's a C++ implementation of the Edit Distance algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to compute the edit distance between two strings
int editDistance(const string& str1, const string& str2) {
    int m = str1.size();
    int n = str2.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));

    // Initialize the dp table
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) dp[i][0] = i;
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) dp[0][j] = j;

    // Fill the dp table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; // No operation needed
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j] + 1,  // Deletion
                                dp[i][j - 1] + 1,  // Insertion
                                dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1}); // Substitution
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
    string str1 = "kitten";
    string str2 = "sitting";

    cout << "Edit distance between \"" << str1 << "\" and \"" << str2 << "\" is " << editDistance(str1, str2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Edit Distance Calculation | O(m * n)      | O(m * n)         |

Where:
- **m**: Length of the first string (`str1`).
- **n**: Length of the second string (`str2`).

```

**Explanation:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), as the algorithm fills a 2D table of size \( m \times n \), where `m` is the length of the first string and `n` is the length of the second string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), due to the storage needed for the 2D table used to compute the edit distance.

**Applications:**
- **Comparing Technology Options**: The edit distance algorithm can be used to measure the similarity between different technology options based on their names or descriptions.
- **Spell Checking and Correction**: It's commonly used in spell checkers to suggest corrections by finding similar words in a dictionary.

The Edit Distance Problem helps in identifying how closely two strings resemble each other, which is crucial for various applications in data analysis, text processing, and decision-making.
