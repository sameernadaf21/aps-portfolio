### Longest Common Substring

The **Longest Common Substring** problem involves finding the longest substring that is common to two given strings. This problem is useful in various applications such as identifying similar patterns in sequences, optimizing routes, and scheduling.

#### Problem Statement

Given two strings, find the longest substring that is present in both of them.

#### C++ Code

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation of the Longest Common Substring problem using dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the length of the longest common substring
int longestCommonSubstring(const string& s1, const string& s2) {
    int m = s1.length();
    int n = s2.length();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][j]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "abcde";
    string s2 = "abfce";

    cout << "Length of the longest common substring: " << longestCommonSubstring(s1, s2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation          | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Longest Common Substring | O(m * n)    | O(m * n)         |

Where:
- **m**: Length of the first string.
- **n**: Length of the second string.

```

**Explanation:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. This is because we need to fill out a 2D table with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), as the space is used to store the 2D dynamic programming table.

**Applications:**
- **Route Optimization**: Identifies common patterns or segments in route data.
- **Scheduling**: Helps in finding common tasks or sequences in schedules.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Useful in DNA sequencing and other fields where finding similar patterns is crucial.

The Longest Common Substring problem is a fundamental problem in string processing and has practical applications in areas requiring efficient comparison and pattern matching.
