### Dice Combinations I

**Dice Combinations I** is a problem that involves finding the number of ways to achieve a target sum using a given number of dice. Each die can roll a number from 1 to 6. This problem is useful in scenarios like tracking product batches and lots where you need to compute different combinations to achieve a specific outcome.

#### Problem Statement

Given `n` dice, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6, determine the number of ways to get a sum equal to `s`.

#### C++ Code

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation to solve the Dice Combinations I problem using dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;


int countDiceCombinations(int n, int s) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(s + 1, 0));

  
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= s; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = 0;
            for (int k = 1; k <= 6; ++k) {
                if (j >= k) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][s];
}

int main() {
    int n = 2; 
    int s = 7; 

    cout << "Number of ways to get a sum of " << s << " with " << n << " dice is: " << countDiceCombinations(n, s) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Dice Combinations   | O(n * s)        | O(n * s)         |

Where:
- **n**: Number of dice.
- **s**: Target sum.

```

**Explanation:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * s), where `n` is the number of dice and `s` is the target sum. Each entry in the `dp` table requires O(6) operations (one for each face of the die), so the complexity remains O(n * s).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * s), as the `dp` table has dimensions `(n+1) x (s+1)`.

**Applications:**
- **Product Batches and Lots**: Useful for tracking different possible configurations or quantities in manufacturing and logistics.
- **Probabilistic Analysis**: Helps in determining the number of possible outcomes in scenarios with multiple stages or components.

Dice Combinations I is a versatile problem in combinatorial mathematics and can be adapted to various practical scenarios requiring the enumeration of possible outcomes.
