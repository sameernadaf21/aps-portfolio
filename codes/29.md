### Ways to Reach a Number

The **Ways to Reach a Number** problem involves finding the number of distinct ways to reach a target number using given steps or increments. This problem is useful for planning and optimizing global supply routes by determining the number of ways to achieve specific goals or milestones.

#### Problem Statement

Given a target number and a list of possible step sizes or increments, compute the number of distinct ways to reach the target number.

#### C++ Code

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation of the problem using dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int waysToReachNumber(int target, const vector<int>& steps) {
    vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
        for (int step : steps) {
            if (i >= step) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - step];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
}

int main() {
    int target = 4; 
    vector<int> steps = {1, 2}; 

    cout << "Number of ways to reach " << target << " is " << waysToReachNumber(target, steps) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Dynamic Programming Table | O(target * k)   | O(target)        |

Where:
- **target**: The target number to reach.
- **k**: Number of possible steps.

```

**Explanation:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(target * k), where `target` is the target number and `k` is the number of possible steps. Each entry in the `dp` array is updated based on all possible steps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(target), due to the storage needed for the `dp` array that holds the number of ways to reach each number from 0 to `target`.

**Applications:**
- **Planning and Optimization**: Helps in determining the number of ways to achieve specific targets or milestones, which can be useful for planning global supply routes and logistics.
- **Resource Allocation**: Useful for allocating resources in various ways to achieve a target efficiently.

The Ways to Reach a Number problem provides a method for planning and optimizing by calculating the number of distinct ways to achieve a goal, which is valuable for logistical and operational decision-making.
