### Binomial Coefficients

**Binomial Coefficients** are used in various combinatorial problems and are especially useful in production planning and lot sizing where combinations and allocations are required. They represent the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set and are often denoted as \( C(n, k) \) or \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

#### Formula

The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \]

where \( ! \) denotes factorial.

#### C++ Code for Binomial Coefficients

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation to calculate binomial coefficients using dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> binomialCoefficients(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> C(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
            if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                C[i][j] = 1;
            } else {
                C[i][j] = C[i - 1][j - 1] + C[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return C;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; 

    vector<vector<int>> C = binomialCoefficients(n);

    cout << "Binomial coefficients for n = " << n << " are:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
            cout << C[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity


| Operation             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Binomial Coefficients Calculation | O(n^2)        | O(n^2)          |

Where:
- **n**: Maximum value for the number of items (rows in Pascal's Triangle).



**Explanation:**

- The `binomialCoefficients` function calculates the binomial coefficients using a 2D vector where `C[i][j]` stores the value of \( \binom{i}{j} \).
- The algorithm fills out this table by using the recurrence relation:
  \[
  \binom{i}{j} = \binom{i-1}{j-1} + \binom{i-1}{j}
  \]
  with boundary conditions: \( \binom{i}{0} = \binom{i}{i} = 1 \).
- This approach allows efficient computation of all binomial coefficients up to \( \binom{n}{n} \) with \( O(n^2) \) time and space complexity.

**Applications:**
- **Production Planning:** Helps in determining combinations of production runs or lots.
- **Lot Sizing:** Useful in calculating the number of ways to choose items or allocate resources.

Binomial coefficients are a fundamental concept in combinatorics and have wide applications in various fields including statistics, probability, and optimization problems.
