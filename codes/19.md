### Copy-On-Write

**Copy-On-Write (COW)** is an optimization strategy used to efficiently handle memory management. It is commonly used in situations where a system needs to make a copy of an object but wants to delay the actual copying until it is absolutely necessary. This helps save memory and reduce the overhead associated with copying objects.

#### C++ Code

Here's an example demonstrating the concept of Copy-On-Write in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <cstring>

class CopyOnWrite {
    std::shared_ptr<std::vector<int>> data;

public:
    CopyOnWrite() : data(std::make_shared<std::vector<int>>()) {}

    CopyOnWrite(const CopyOnWrite& other) : data(other.data) {}

    CopyOnWrite& operator=(const CopyOnWrite& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            data = other.data;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    void set(int index, int value) {
        
        if (data.use_count() > 1) {
            data = std::make_shared<std::vector<int>>(*data);
        }
        (*data)[index] = value;
    }

    int get(int index) const {
        return (*data)[index];
    }

    void print() const {
        for (int value : *data) {
            std::cout << value << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    CopyOnWrite cow1;
    cow1.set(0, 10);
    cow1.set(1, 20);

    CopyOnWrite cow2 = cow1; 
    cow2.set(2, 30); 

    std::cout << "cow1 data: ";
    cow1.print(); 

    std::cout << "cow2 data: ";
    cow2.print(); 

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity


| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Set (with copy)     | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Set (without copy)  | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Get                 | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Print               | O(n)            | O(1)             |

Where:
- **n**: Number of elements in the data structure.


In this example:
- **CopyOnWrite** uses shared pointers to manage a vector of integers. 
- When an object is copied, it shares the underlying data.
- If a modification is made, it triggers a copy of the data, ensuring that changes do not affect other objects that share the same data.

This approach is useful for scenarios where copying large data structures is expensive, and modifications are infrequent.
