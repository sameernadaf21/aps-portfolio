### Stolen Value Problem

**Stolen Value Problem** is a variation of the classic Knapsack problem. The goal is to maximize the total value of items that can be stolen from a series of houses, where each house has a value and a weight (or capacity constraint). 

Here, we assume each house has a fixed value, and the problem is to find the maximum value that can be stolen given a weight capacity constraint.

#### C++ Code

Here's a basic implementation of the Stolen Value Problem using dynamic programming:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the maximum value that can be stolen
int maxStolenValue(const vector<int>& values, const vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
    int n = values.size();
    vector<int> dp(capacity + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int w = capacity; w >= weights[i]; --w) {
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
        }
    }

    return dp[capacity];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> values = {60, 100, 120};
    vector<int> weights = {10, 20, 30};
    int capacity = 50;

    cout << "Maximum value that can be stolen: " << maxStolenValue(values, weights, capacity) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity


| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Initialization      | O(n * capacity) | O(capacity)      |
| Value Calculation   | O(n * capacity) | O(capacity)      |

Where:
- **n**: Number of items (or houses).
- **capacity**: Maximum weight (or capacity constraint).


In this implementation:
- `values` is a vector of values of items.
- `weights` is a vector of weights corresponding to those values.
- `capacity` is the maximum weight capacity that can be carried.

The `dp` vector stores the maximum value that can be achieved for each weight from `0` to `capacity`. The function iterates through each item and updates the `dp` array accordingly.
