### Max Value of Gifts

The **Max Value of Gifts** problem involves determining the maximum value of gifts that can be collected given constraints such as a limited carrying capacity or specific gift constraints. This problem is a variation of the knapsack problem and is useful for optimizing resource allocation.

#### Problem Statement

Given a set of gifts, each with a value and weight, and a maximum weight capacity, find the maximum value of gifts that can be carried without exceeding the capacity.

#### C++ Code

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation using dynamic programming for the 0/1 Knapsack problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;


int maxValueOfGifts(const vector<int>& values, const vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
    int n = values.size();
    vector<int> dp(capacity + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int w = capacity; w >= weights[i]; --w) {
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i]);
        }
    }

    return dp[capacity];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> values = {60, 100, 120};
    vector<int> weights = {10, 20, 30}; 
    int capacity = 50; // Maximum capacity

    cout << "Maximum value of gifts: " << maxValueOfGifts(values, weights, capacity) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time and Space Complexity

### Time and Space Complexity

| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Dynamic Programming | O(n * capacity) | O(capacity)      |

Where:
- **n**: Number of gifts.
- **capacity**: Maximum carrying capacity.

```

**Explanation:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * capacity), where `n` is the number of gifts and `capacity` is the maximum weight capacity. The time complexity comes from iterating over each gift and each possible weight up to the capacity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(capacity), as we use a one-dimensional array `dp` to store the maximum values for each possible weight up to the capacity.

**Applications:**
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps in optimizing resource allocation by selecting the most valuable items that can be carried within a given capacity.
- **Planning and Budgeting**: Useful in scenarios where budget constraints or capacity limits need to be managed while maximizing value.

The Max Value of Gifts problem demonstrates how dynamic programming can be applied to optimize resource allocation and make efficient decisions in various planning and budgeting scenarios.
