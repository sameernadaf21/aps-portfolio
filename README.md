## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my learnings and insights into Supply Chain Management (SCM). Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of key SCM concepts, strategies, and their applications in solving real-world challenges.

## Why Supply Chain Management?

<img align="right" src="https://example.com/supply-chain-image.jpg" width="180">

Supply Chain Management fascinates me due to its critical role in ensuring the smooth flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers. The complexity of managing and optimizing supply chains, coupled with the impact on business efficiency and customer satisfaction, drives my passion for this field. My goal is to leverage advanced SCM strategies to enhance operational performance and drive innovation.

## Objective
The main goal of this portfolio is to illustrate my understanding and application of SCM principles to address real-world challenges and optimize supply chain operations.

## Use Cases

### 1. üì¶ **Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management**

#### USE CASE:

Accurate demand forecasting and effective inventory management are crucial for balancing supply and demand. Techniques like Time Series Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Machine Learning Algorithms are used to predict demand and optimize inventory levels.

#### CHALLENGES:

Predicting demand accurately in the face of fluctuating market conditions. Balancing inventory levels to avoid overstocking or stockouts. Integrating forecasting models with inventory management systems for real-time adjustments.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Time Series Analysis**: Predicts future demand based on historical data. [1] [Code](./codes/1.md)

- **Regression Analysis**: Analyzes relationships between variables to forecast demand. [2] [Code](./codes/2.md)

- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses algorithms like Random Forest and Neural Networks for advanced demand forecasting. [3] [Code](./codes/3.md)


### 2. üöö **Logistics and Transportation Optimization**

#### USE CASE:

Optimizing logistics and transportation involves managing routes, reducing costs, and improving delivery efficiency. Algorithms like Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and Genetic Algorithms are used to enhance logistics operations.

#### CHALLENGES:

Balancing cost reduction with service level improvements. Handling dynamic changes in routes and transportation requirements. Integrating logistics optimization with real-time data for adaptive decision-making.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**: Finds the shortest route for transportation. [4] [Code](./codes/4.md)

- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Optimizes vehicle routes for efficient delivery. [5] [Code](./codes/5.md)

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Uses evolutionary techniques to solve complex optimization problems. [6] [Code](./codes/6.md)


### 3. üîÑ **Supplier Relationship Management**

#### USE CASE:

Managing supplier relationships involves evaluating supplier performance, negotiating terms, and ensuring compliance. Techniques like Supplier Scorecards, Contract Management Systems, and Risk Assessment Models are used to enhance supplier management.

#### CHALLENGES:

Maintaining strong relationships while negotiating favorable terms. Evaluating and managing supplier risks. Ensuring compliance with contract terms and performance metrics.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Supplier Scorecards**: Evaluates supplier performance based on key metrics. [7] [Code](./codes/7.md)

- **Contract Management Systems**: Manages and tracks contract obligations and compliance. [8] [Code](./codes/8.md)

- **Risk Assessment Models**: Identifies and mitigates potential supplier risks. [9] [Code](./codes/9.md)


### 4. üìà **Supply Chain Analytics**

#### USE CASE:

Supply chain analytics involves analyzing data to gain insights and drive decision-making. Techniques like Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics, and Prescriptive Analytics are used to improve supply chain visibility and performance.

#### CHALLENGES:

Handling and analyzing large volumes of supply chain data. Integrating analytics with operational processes for actionable insights. Ensuring data accuracy and relevance for effective decision-making.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Analyzes historical data to understand past performance. [10] [Code](./codes/10.md)

- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses statistical models and machine learning to forecast future trends. [11] [Code](./codes/11.md)

- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Provides recommendations for optimal decision-making. [12] [Code](./codes/12.md)


### 5. üîí **Supply Chain Risk Management**

#### USE CASE:

Managing supply chain risks involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential disruptions. Techniques like Risk Assessment Frameworks, Scenario Planning, and Contingency Planning are used to enhance risk management.

#### CHALLENGES:

Identifying and assessing a wide range of potential risks. Developing effective contingency plans to respond to disruptions. Balancing risk mitigation with operational efficiency.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Risk Assessment Frameworks**: Evaluates potential risks and their impact on supply chains. [13] [Code](./codes/13.md)

- **Scenario Planning**: Develops and analyzes different scenarios to prepare for potential disruptions. [14] [Code](./codes/14.md)

- **Contingency Planning**: Prepares actionable plans for managing disruptions and mitigating risks. [15] [Code](./codes/15.md)


### 6. üåç **Sustainable Supply Chain Management**

#### USE CASE:

Implementing sustainable practices in supply chain management involves reducing environmental impact and promoting social responsibility. Techniques like Green Logistics, Circular Economy Models, and Sustainable Sourcing are used to enhance sustainability.

#### CHALLENGES:

Balancing sustainability goals with cost and operational efficiency. Implementing and monitoring sustainable practices across the supply chain. Ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and standards.

#### STRATEGIES USED:

- **Green Logistics**: Reduces environmental impact through efficient logistics practices. [16] [Code](./codes/16.md)

- **Circular Economy Models**: Promotes recycling and reuse within supply chains. [17] [Code](./codes/17.md)

- **Sustainable Sourcing**: Ensures ethical and environmentally-friendly sourcing of materials. [18] [Code](./codes/18.md)
